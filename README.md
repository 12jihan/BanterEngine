### Banter Engine

So, of course, I recreated this engine because I was following a tutorial before and had no idea what I was doing.
I figured it would be quite a bit more beneficial for me just to learn how to do it without extensive hand-holding and just go at it and learn things from what I can find online.
This is not a full-scale application, so keep that in mind if anyone decides that they want to fork it.
I think it would be pretty great, though, for a boilerplate or anyone who is just now starting and trying to figure out how it works.
